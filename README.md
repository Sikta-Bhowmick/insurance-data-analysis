# insurance-data-analysis
1. Project  Overview:
   This project leverages Power BI to deliver a dynamic dashboard that analyzes customer data across multiple dimensions- age, region, BMI, smoking habits, and insurance charges. It's designed to explore the behavioral patterns and risk insights that can help in targeted decision-making in insurance strategy, health planning, or customer segmentation.


2. Purpose:
     In this project I tried to simplify and visualize complex customer datasets into actionable insights, focusing on risk indicators and regional behavioral trends.


3. Data Source:
   The dataset is sourced from an open insurance dataset containing:
     age, gender, BMI
     Smoking status
     Region (NE, NW, SE, SW)
     Number of children
     Insurance charges
